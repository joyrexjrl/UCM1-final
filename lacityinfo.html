                    <img class="city-image-general city-image1" src="images/la ca/downtown_la.webp" alt="los angeles downtown" width="800px" height="540px">
                    <h2 class="line-graphic-ender">Downtown Los Angeles</h2>
                    <p class="city-info-text">Los Angeles, often referred to by its initials L.A., is the most populous city in the U.S. state of California. With roughly 3.9 million residents within the city limits as of 2020, Los Angeles is the second-most populous city in the United States, behind only New York City; it is also the commercial, financial and cultural center of Southern California. Los Angeles has an ethnically and culturally diverse population, and is the principal city of a metropolitan area of 13.2 million people. Greater Los Angeles, which includes the Los Angeles and Riverside San Bernardino metropolitan areas, is a sprawling metropolis of over 18 million residents.</p>
                    <p class="city-info-text">The majority of the city proper lies in a basin in Southern California adjacent to the Pacific Ocean in the west and extending partly through the Santa Monica Mountains and north into the San Fernando Valley, with the city bordering the San Gabriel Valley to its east. It covers about 469 square miles, and is the county seat of Los Angeles County, which is the most populous county in the United States with an estimated 9.86 million residents as of 2022. It is the fourth-most visited city in the U.S. with over 2.7 million visitors as of 2022. </p>

                    <h2 class="line-graphic-ender">Famious Beaches</h2>
                    <p class="city-info-text">Venice Beach is one of the top attractions in Los Angeles County for a reason. This mile and a half of soft sand makes for great lounging, but no trip would be complete without a walk along the Venice Boardwalk. This one-mile street market near the Venice Pier is bustling with activity from street performers and skaters. </p>
                    <p class="city-info-text">Santa Monica Beach is home to the Santa Monica Pier, ocean-view hotels, and stunning white sand. There are plenty of parking lots along the beach, and you can walk along the paved path until you find a good spot to forge out onto the sand. Between playing in the waves and spending an hour or two on pier rides, the kids will be totally exhausted. Sister hotels Shutters on the Beach and Casa del Mar make great options for luxurious overnights or nice dinners by the sea. </p>
                    <p class="city-info-text">Point Dume in Malibu has it all: a crescent-shaped beach, clear water, and a scuba spot where you might even meet some sea lions. This is a great beach for swimming and body surfing. It is also a popular destination for rock climbers, who you will spot repelling off the cliffs over the beach. If you are looking for an oceanside hike, follow the trails up craggy cliffs for a 360-degree view of Santa Monica Bay. During winter and early spring, you may even catch a glimpse of gray whales migrating south. </p>

                    <h2 class="line-graphic-ender">Universal Studios</h2>
                    <p class="city-info-text">Universal Studios Hollywood is a film studio and theme park in the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles County, California. About 70% of the studio lies within the unincorporated county island known as Universal City while the rest lies within the city limits of Los Angeles, California. It is one of the oldest and most famous Hollywood film studios still in use. Its official marketing headline is "The Entertainment Capital of LA". It was initially created to offer tours of the real Universal Studios sets and is the first of many full-fledged Universal Studios Theme Parks located across the world. </p>
                    <p class="city-info-text">Outside the theme park, a new, all-digital facility near the Universal Pictures backlot was built in an effort to merge all of NBCUniversal's West Coast operations into one area. As a result, the current home for KNBC, KVEA and NBC News with Noticias Telemundo Los Angeles Bureaus with new digital facility is on the Universal lot formerly occupied by Technicolor SA. Universal City includes hotels Universal Hilton & Towers, the Sheraton Universal Hotel, and Universal CityWalk, which offers a collection of shops, restaurants, an 18-screen Universal Cinema and a seven-story IMAX theater. In 2017, the park hosted 9.056 million guests, ranking it 15th in the world and 9th among North American parks.</p>
